 Core Functionality

Listen for client connections: Your proxy server needs to listen on a specific port (e.g., 8080) for incoming client requests.
Parse client requests: When a client connects, the proxy needs to understand the request (e.g., HTTP requests for web pages). This involves parsing the request method (GET, POST, etc.), the target URL, and any headers.
Forward requests to the destination server: The proxy establishes a connection to the actual server the client wants to reach. It then forwards the client's request to that server.
Receive the server's response: The proxy receives the response from the destination server.
Relay the response to the client: The proxy sends the server's response back to the original client.
2. Key Considerations

Concurrency: You'll need to handle multiple client connections simultaneously. Rust's tokio library provides excellent tools for asynchronous programming and handling concurrent connections.
Error Handling: Robust error handling is crucial. Network operations can fail for various reasons (network issues, server errors, etc.).
Protocol Support: Start with supporting HTTP, the most common protocol. You could later expand to support HTTPS (secure HTTP) and other protocols.
Caching (Optional): For performance, you might implement caching to store frequently accessed resources and serve them directly without contacting the remote server.
3. Tools and Libraries

tokio: An asynchronous runtime for Rust, essential for handling network I/O efficiently.
hyper: A popular HTTP library for Rust, useful for parsing HTTP requests and responses.
rustls: A TLS library for implementing HTTPS support.
4.  Code Structure (Simplified Example)

Rust

use tokio::net::{TcpListener, TcpStream};
use tokio::io::{AsyncReadExt, AsyncWriteExt};
use hyper::{Request, Body, Response, StatusCode};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let listener = TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:8080").await?;

    loop {
        let (stream, _) = listener.accept().await?;
        tokio::spawn(async move {
            handle_client(stream).await;
        });
    }
}

async fn handle_client(mut client_stream: TcpStream) {
    // 1. Read client request (using hyper for HTTP parsing)
    let mut buf = [0; 1024];
    let n = client_stream.read(&mut buf).await.unwrap(); 
    let request = Request::from_parts(
        // ... parse HTTP request from buf ...
    );

    // 2. Forward request to destination server
    let mut server_stream = TcpStream::connect(request.uri().authority().unwrap().as_str()).await.unwrap(); 
    // ... send the request to the server ...

    // 3. Receive server response
    let mut server_response = Vec::new();
    server_stream.read_to_end(&mut server_response).await.unwrap();

    // 4. Relay response to client
    client_stream.write_all(&server_response).await.unwrap(); 
}
5.  Steps to Build

Project Setup: Create a new Rust project (cargo new proxy-server).
Dependencies: Add tokio, hyper, and potentially rustls to your Cargo.toml file.
Implementation: Start with the basic TCP listener and client handling.
HTTP Parsing: Use hyper to parse HTTP requests and generate responses.
Forwarding: Implement the logic to connect to the target server and forward requests/responses.
Testing: Thoroughly test your proxy server with different websites and requests.
Important Notes:

Security: If you handle HTTPS, you'll need to deal with SSL/TLS certificates.
Ethics: Be mindful of the ethical implications of using a proxy server. Ensure you're not using it for any illegal or harmful activities.
Complexity: This is a simplified overview. Building a full-featured proxy server involves more advanced concepts like connection pooling, request routing, and potentially authentication.
